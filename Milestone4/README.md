# Heart Stroke Prediction Project

This repository contains the complete implementation and analysis for the **Heart Stroke Prediction** project. The project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of a stroke based on patient data. 

 **Milestone 4**: Final Model and Project Summary
   - Combined all code into a single file.
   - Calculated Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Accuracy for Logistic Regression.
   - Generated a Confusion Matrix graph.
   - Conducted bias analysis and mathematical concept explanation.
   - Created a PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project.

## Model Evaluation

The project focuses on evaluating models using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

---

## Results

The Logistic Regression model achieved the best results in terms of precision and recall, making it the most suitable for this dataset. The detailed comparison of all models is included in the PowerPoint presentation.

---

## Visualization

Data visualizations, including the Confusion Matrix and key feature correlations, are part of the analysis. They provide insights into the dataset and the model's behavior.
